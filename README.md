## Conquest Reforged Paintbrush

Conquest Reforged Paintbrush adds a creative paintbrush that allows the user to "copy" and "paste" the material of a block onto another block while maintaining it's variant and properties. It also adds a paintknife which allows the user to change the layer properties of a targeted block.
Usage

## Primary click:

- With a **paintbrush** to copy the targeted block's material to the **paintbrush**.
- With a **paintknife** will decrease the layer of a targeted block if it has layer properties.

## Secondary click:

- With a **paintbrush** to paint the selected material onto the targeted block. This attempts to find the same block variant in a material's conquest family.
- With a **paintknife** will increase the layer of a targeted block if it has layer properties.

## Hold "Left Ctrl":

- With a **paintbrush** while selecting a material to select in strict mode. All painted blocks will be an exact copy.
- With a **paintknife** will change layers for a block adjacent to the blockface targeted.

**Crouching** will show the material that is currently selected on a paintbrush.
